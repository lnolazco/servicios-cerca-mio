# Servicios Cerca Mio

## Getting started

Clone repository:
`git clone git@github.com:lnolazco/servicios-cerca-mio.git`

You now have a new directory called servicios-cerca-mio. Let’s cd into it:
`cd servicios-cerca-mio`

Then install all dependencies

`npm install`

To start run the following command.

`npm run dev`

This starts your Next.js app’s "development server" on port 3000.

Let’s check to see if it’s working. Open http://localhost:3000 from your browser.
